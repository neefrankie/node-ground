# FormData

The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value
pairs to send using the Fetch or XMLHttpRequest API.
It is primarily intended for use in sending form data,
but can be used independently from forms in order to
transmit keyed data.
The transmitted data is in teh same format that the form's
submit() method would use to send the data if the form's
encoding type were set to `multipart/form-data`.
