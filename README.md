# A Node.js and frontend playground

## Tooling

A compiler performs parsing of the source codes, generates abstract syntax tree and transforms the code into another representation.

A bundler links multiple files into a single one.

This project demonstrate 3 sets of tooling for bundling and transpiling:

* rollup + tsc
* esbuild
* spack + swc

Alternatively you can use rollup + babel + preset-typescript to replace the first group.

### Compiler

* Typescript compiler
* Babel
* swc
* esbuild

### Bundler

* webpack
